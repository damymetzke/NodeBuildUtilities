    - The documentation for a section is lacking in its entirety.
    - There existing documentation is outdated, misleading or vague.
    - You personally, or somebody else, had trouble doing something that could be helped by proper documentation.

    Please do not request documentation in the following situations:

    In these cases a PR is more suited.
