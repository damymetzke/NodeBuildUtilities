<!--
    The request is specifically for MAJOR features.
    This is defined by any feature that will take multiple PR's to complete.
    Some major features are bigger than others, but they will never be linked to a single PR.
    Besides this they are identical to normal feature requests.
-->

<!--
    Before submitting a feature request please consider the following:
    - Ask yourself if this feature really fits this project.
    - The feature should not add additional mandatory setup for the project.
    - The feature should work with promises + async/await.
    - The feature should work with vanilla JavaScript/TypeScript,
    - Do not suggest to add unnecessary complexity.
-->

## Problem
<!--
    All suggestions can be worded as a problem.
    Some examples:
    - It is not possible to do X.
    - When doing X it is not possible to do Y.
    - Doing X forces the developer to do Y.
    - Doing X is too complex.

    Most of the time these questions can be followed by a 'because ...'.
